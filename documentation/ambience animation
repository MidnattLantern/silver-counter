This project is built with Typescript. Using the vanilla approach by importing assets won't work. React need assets to be imported as components before they can be used. IE
``` typescript
import Ambience from "../../assets/wallpaper/SilverAmbientAnimation.gif";
```

The component itself has a low resolution to save space and memory, because it will be blurred anyways, the quality doesn't matter.
Blurring is achieved from the cascade styles sheet with the filter.
Pointer-events disable interaction with the wallpaper, preventing awkward interaction.
Posiiton is fixed so that the wallpaper is stacked on the z-axis rather than x or y.
This component function as the wallpaper for silver list.
```css
.FitAmbience{
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    filter: blur(100px);
    position: fixed;
    pointer-events: none;
}
```

Elements displaying over this window will be automatically hidden. By adding:
`    backdrop-filter: blur(0px);`
to the base element, it will appear above the ambience animation
